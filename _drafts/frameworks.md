Serverside frameworks are becoming few and far between. This is a side effect of the expanding influence and technology of frontend frameworks that are beginning to mature. Ember, Angular, and React are the front-runners, and they are here to stay. They learned from the problems of Backbone, Knockout, and countless others that have no been lost to the history of a year ago, while at the same time extracting the best qualities from them and from one another to produce a mature useful foundation on which individuals and companies can base their products.

Data accessibility has always been the reason for serverside frameworks and that single reason is why they still exist. Serving HTML/JS/CSS and accessing a database is the sole reason for a server and frontend frameworks have trimmed the fat down to nothing more than an API. Ember even handles URLs correctly out of the box. This mixed with mobile web and ever speedier JS engines is the last nail in the coffin of the serverside web framework. Drupal and Wordpress feel antiquated when you look at how Ember and React handle templating and data modeling. Sure there will always be the company out there that wants to use .NET for their custom CMS, but they will soon not be able to compete on speed with websites using these frontend frameworks.

Things are moving fast and if you don't know JavaScript you'd better get yourself some learning or crack open your CS text book, because you probably don't have a fulltime web programming job. Everything is so fast and easy to setup, contract work is more prevalent than ever. Not to mention the whole full-stack web developer non-sense going around. It's a different world even after 4-5 years in the industry and things are only going to change faster. So strap on your helmets folks, it's gonna be a ride.
