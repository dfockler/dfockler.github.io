				<h1>Building things that Fail - 05/14/2014</h1>
				As a web developer a lot of the time I feel like things I do are not very much like programming. I'm configuring tools, piping data into a particular part of a web page, or just generally doing the programming equivalent of plumbing. This means the problems I face are with other people's software (mostly CMSes) and not really about me solving problems. I'm plumbing someone's toilet so they can use it to go to the bathroom. It's a wonderful thing to have, a toilet or a nice website, but we've pretty much solved both of those problems. But recently I've been thinking about what goes into getting to a tried and true method to solve a problem and what that means.
				<br>
				<br>
				For me personally it's so easy to look at a finished thing and say, "Whoa that's impressive. I could never do that." When you drill down into stuff like that it's all iteration. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is software. It takes time, iteration, and thought. It doesn't come in a flash of brilliance and it doesn't come from geniuses. You start out with something that solves your problem and you add on to it. It's that simple. Even the best software in the world isn't on version 1.0.0 forever. Bugs happen and we can't let that stop us from building things and finding errors. Most of us aren't building software that will kill someone if implemented incorrectly, god bless you if you are, but most of us aren't. It's ok to fail.
				<br>
				<br>
				Start with a prototype, an idea, a single dirty file filed with bad code. That's what refactoring is for. Use what you made, and find issues with it. Break it, test it, refactor it, rewrite it, rearchitect it. That's why code is brilliant! It's not static, it's not frozen, it's wonderfully editable. You can build anything with code, and that means you can change anything in code as well. What other parts of your existence can you build something that fails, and keep rebuilding it until it works with out any consequence but your time? It may not be good the first time, but you can always change it later.

				<h1>The Case for Deconstruction - 04/16/2014</h1>
				Often times we build and we build and we build to no end. One of the main tools programmers use is abstraction, and it is abused often. It's easy to bandy the word abstraction about and make it seem like what you are doing is useful, but our goal as developers is problem solving. When you take abstraction too far, you end up on the opposite end of where you started. You went too far past your problem to another problem 10 steps past the current one.
				<br>
				<br>
				Abstraction isn't just about code reusability it's about breaking down the problem you are solving into pieces you can easily examine and solve. We ought to deconstruct our problem into smaller parts and then abstract them into a form simple enough we can think and reason about without losing the essence or logic of the problem. Code reuse is a side affect of breaking a problem into pieces and figuring out that some pieces look the same. It should not be a goal from the beginning. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Design patterns are an example of this idea of abstracting too early while problem solving. Beginning programmers can easily misuse the idea of design patterns by assuming their problem fits into the abstraction of the pattern. They then hack around the design pattern to fit their problem, when instead they should deconstruct their problem first and see if the pieces fit into the design pattern. Design patterns should be used as a guide to deconstruct your problem.
				<br>
				<br>
				When you come at a problem only from a 'high level' view point, you more often than not end up with lots of code hacked in place to fit into the structure you masterplanned at the beginning of the project. Deconstruction is the perfect way to start a project, and it's a better way to use abstraction. Deconstruction is an idea that fits into almost any problem solving strategy, and is super useful for more than just programming.
